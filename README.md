# About

I did this project with the aim of learning the basics of nodejs as I want to focus my studies on nestjs, I uploaded it in a way that only save it locally (for now) and without a database as I intend to save it on AWS in the future

## Cloning the Project
If you want to clone the project, just copy the ssh key and write "git clone (ssh key)" in your terminal,  and with the project open, open your editor's terminal and type ```yarn``` to install the dependencies, 
after that, type ```yarn dev``` to run the project.
